# Mailing List Handler

## Learning Goals

- Model data and relationships
- Use ruby classes to solve problems

## Introduction

Design and implement a Mailing List Handler. As you do, think back to the
principles of Object Oriented design as you build your solution. Are there
refactors that would make your code easier to reason about, test, and extend?

1. Read the [Mailing List Handler problem description][description] and
   [Design Considerations][].
2. Use [DB Diagram][] (or a whiteboard) to draw out the relationships between
   your data models.
3. Build the functionality of the system in ruby. As you go, write tests to
   ensure that you've got the behavior right.

After you finish your solution, get a colleague to review your code and
give you feedback:

- do you have the right data model and relationships?
- do you have the right classes?
- do your classes have the right responsibilities?
- are your classes, variables, and methods named clearly and unambiguously?
- are your methods succinct and clear?
